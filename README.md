# ShortLinks

This contains 2 projects.

The first is ShortLinksRedirect which uses ASP.NET API to redirect users to the appropriate page and gather some statistical data
The second is ShortLinksAdmin which is an administrator console to create/add/delete/edit/view info on links.

The links created will follow the URL this is hosted on.

If the URL is test.me and you create a link that uses 'here' as it's identifier you will get a link test.me/here that can link to a much larger URL.
